                <h3> Music</h3>
                    From an early age, melodies have been my companions through every emotion.
                    I have been trained in Hindustani classical music for three years. I also play synthesizer and
                    harmonium. I am an avid listener of old evergreen Indian music and Rabindra sangeet.
                    
                 <h3> RMS Titanic</h3>
                    The story of RMS Titanic has always been a fascination for me. The doomed ship represents an incredible blend of opulence, tragedy and human resilience. Its history,
                    from being a practically unsinkable vessel to its tragic maiden voyage, captivates my interest. The sheer scale and grandeur of the Titanic,
                    once considered the epitome of luxury and innovation, draws me back to the Edwardian era where engineering and ambition blended. Exploring its beautiful design, the lives of those aboard, and the events
                    leading upto its ill-fated collision with an iceberg evokes curiosity and sorrow. The loss of the 1496 souls aboard the ship reminds us of the unpredictability
                    of life and the helplessness of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The ongoing quests to uncover more about the Titanic's wreckage and the stories behind its passengers and crew
                    continue to fuel my curiosity.

                    For serious enthusiasts, I would recommend the following three books (though there are many) which are extremely meticulous and well-researched:
